# common-tools
Common Pascal functions for our informatics lessons at school.

### Installation
To use the common-tools library, download the zipball into your delphi project folder. I have tested this with Delphi 7, since we use that at school, but I might port it to Lazarus / FreePascal too.
After downloading the source code, you have to enter the following into your project file:
```
uses
  SysUtils,
  {$INCLUDE common-tools/CommonTools.pas};
```
